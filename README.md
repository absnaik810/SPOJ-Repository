This repository contains solutions to almost all problems I have solved on SPOJ. They're intended as a last resort in case you've tried very hard to solve a problem but you just haven't been able to figure it out. Sometimes I'm unable to solve a problem until after I looked at some code. So obviously the code helps, and there can be good reasons to just look at code rather than being stuck indefinitely.

Also, please note that some (by some, I mean very very few) codes may not work, simply because I might be working on them myself, or I would have worked on them when I was offline for a long time and forgot to upload the correct solution later. If you come across such cases, then please feel free to make the necessary updates (or alternatively, contact me).  Also, some of the solutions may have bad coding stylye and a poor mastery of C and C++. Sorry for that!!

The copyright notice (LICENSE) applies to all code.  There is technically no license for the code that I must have referred on the internet that I'm aware of, but it's unlikely you'll get into any trouble for using it or redistributing it freely.

For a few problems I have multiple solutions, usually because after my first successful submission I discovered there was a much better way to solve the problem. Those are indicated as required with updated version numbers.
